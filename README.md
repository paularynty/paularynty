## Hi friend, nice to see you here! 👋

🌱 I'm Paula Rynty, HR specialist/coach turned designer turned budding programmer.

💫 Currently studying at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/) with a focus on C/C++, Unix, algorithms, and networks.

🐝 Fostering a buzzing passion for anything where code and visual design meet. 

I am a multifaceted, ever-evolving doer. My roots lie strongly in coaching multiple different teams for customer success
<br>and overall better work performance, as well as copywriting and design for strengthening company brand awareness.
<br>I am excited to apply these skills alongside my newly acquired technical ones to my first programming internship.
